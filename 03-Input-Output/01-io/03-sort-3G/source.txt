   Snow, Glass, Apples
   I do not know what manner of thing she is. None of us do. She killed her mo
ther in the birthing, but that's never enough to account for it.
   They call me wise, but I am far from wise, for all that I fores
aw fragments of it, frozen moments caught in pools of water or in the cold glass of my mirror. If I were wise I would not h
ave tried to change what I saw. If I were wise I would have kil
led myself before ever I encountered her, before ever I caught him.
   Wise, and a witch, or so they said, and I'd seen his face in my dreams and in reflections for all my life: sixteen years of dreaming of him before he reined his horse by the bridge that morning, and asked my name. He helped me onto his high horse and we rode together to my little cottage, my face buried in the gold of his hair. He asked for the best of what I had; a king's right, it was.
   His beard was red-bronze in the morning light
, an
d I knew h
im, not as a king, for
 I knew nothing of kings then
, but as my love. He took all he wanted from me, the right of k
ings, but he returned to me on the following day, and on the night afte
r that: his beard so red, his hair so gold, his eyes the blue of a summer sky, hi
s skin tanned the gentle brown of ripe wheat.
   His daughter was only a child: no more than five years of age when I c
ame to the palace. A portrait of her dead mother hung in the princess's tower room; a tall woman, hair the colour of dark wood, 
eyes nut-brown. She was of a different blood to her pale daughter.
   The girl would not eat with us.
   I do not know wh
ere in the palace she ate.
   I had my own chambers. My husband the king, he had his own rooms also. When he wanted me he woul
d send for me, and I would go to him, and pleasure him, and take my pleasure with him.
   One night, several months after I was brou
ght to the palace, she came to my rooms. She was six. I was embroidering by lamplight, squinting my eyes against the lamp's smoke and fitfu
l illumination.
   When I looked up, she was there.
   "Princess?"
   She said nothing. Her eyes were black as coal, black as her hair; her lip
s were redder than blood. She looked up at me and smiled. Her teeth seemed sharp, even then, in the lamplight.
   "What are you doing away from your roo
m?"
   "I'm hungry," she said, like any child.
   It was winter, when fre
sh food is a dream of warmth and sunlight; but I had strings of whole apples, cored and 
dried, hanging from the beams of my chamber, and I pulled an apple down for
 her.
   "Here."
   Autumn is the time of drying, of preserving, a time of picking apples, o
f rendering the goose fat. Winter is the time of hunger, of snow, and of deat
h; and it is the time of the midwinter feast, when we rub the goose-fat i
nto the skin of a whole pig, stuffed with that autumn's apples, then we roast it
 or spit it, and we prepare to feast upon the crackling.
   She took the dried apple from me and beg
an to chew it with her sharp yellow teeth.
   "Is it good?"
   She nodded. I had always been scared of the li
ttle pri
ncess, but at that moment I warmed to her and, with my fingers, gently, I stroked her cheek. She look
ed at me and sm
iled -- she smiled but rarely -- then she sank her teeth into the base of my thumb, the Mound of Venus, and she drew blood
.
   I began to shriek, from pain and from surprise; but she looked at me and I fell silent.
   The little Princess fastened her mouth to my hand and licked and
 sucked and drank. When she was finished, she left my chamber.
   Beneath my gaze the cut that she had made began to close, to scab, and to heal. The next d
ay it was an old scar: I might have cut my hand with a pocket-knife in my childhood.
   I had been frozen by her, owned and dominated. That scared me, more tha
n the blood she had fed on. After that night I locked my chamber door at dusk, barring it with an oak
en pole, and I had the smith forge iron bars, which he placed across my windows.
   My husb
and
, my love, my king, sent for me less and less, and when I came to him he was dizzy, listless, confuse
d. He could no longer make love as a man makes love; and he would not permit me to pleasure him with my mout
h: the one time I tried, he started, violently, and began to weep. I pulled my mouth away and held him tightly, un
til the sobbing had stopped, and he slept, like a child.
   I ran my fingers across his skin as he slept. It was covered in a mu
ltitude of ancient scars. But I could recall no scars from the days of our courtship, save one, on his side, where a boar had gored him when he was a youth.
   Soon he was a shadow of the man I had met and loved by the bridge.
   His bones showed, blue and white, beneath his skin. I was with him at the last: his hands were cold as stone, his eyes milky-blue, his hair and beard faded and lustreless and limp. He died unshriven, his skin nipped and pocked from head to toe with tiny, old scars.
   He weighed near to nothing. The ground was frozen hard, and we could di
g no grave fo
r him, so we made a cairn of rocks and stones above his body, as a memorial only, for there was little enough of him left to protect from the hunger of the beas
ts and the birds.
   So I was queen.
   And I was foolish, and young -- eighteen summers had co
me and gone since first I saw daylight -- and I did not do what I wo
uld do, now.
   If it were today, I would have her heart cut out, true. But then I would have her he
ad and arms and legs cut off. I would have them disembowel her. And then I would watch, in the town squa
re, as the hangman heated the fire to white-heat with bellows, watch unblinking as he consigne
d each part of he
r to the fire. I would have archers around the square, who would shoot any bird or animal who came close to the flames, any 
raven or dog or hawk or rat. And I would not close my eyes until the princess was ash, and a ge
ntle wind could scatter her like s
now.
   I did not do this thing, and we pay for our mistakes.
   They say I was fooled; that it was not her heart. That it w
as the heart of an animal -- a stag, perhaps, or a boar. They say that, and they are wrong.
   And s
ome say (but it is her lie, not mi
ne) that I was given the heart, and that I ate it. Lies and half-truths fall like snow, covering the things that I remember, the things I sa
w. A landscape, unrecognisable after a snowfall; that is what she has made of my life.
   There were scars on my love, her father's thighs, and on 
his ballock-pouch, and on his male member, when he died.
   I did not go with them. They took her in the day, while she slept, and was at her wea
kest. They took her to the heart of the forest, and there they opened her blouse, and they cut out her heart, and they left her dead, in a gully, for th
e fo
rest t
o s
wallow.
   The fores
t is a dark place, the border to many ki
ngdoms; no-one would be foolish eno
ug
h
 t
o claim jurisdic
tion over it. Outlaws live in the fores
t. Robbers live in the forest, and so do wolves
. You can ride through the forest for a dozen days and ne
ver see a soul; but there are eyes upon you the entire t
ime.
   They brought me her heart. I know it was hers -- no sow's heart or doe's would have continu
ed to beat and pulse after it had been cut out, as that one did.
   I took it to my chamber.
   I did not eat it: I hung it from the b
eams above my be
d, placed it on a length of twine that I strung with rowan-berries, orange-red as a robin's breast; and with bulbs of garlic.
   Ou
tside, the snow fel
l, covering the footprints of my huntsmen, covering her tiny body in the forest where it lay.
   I had the smith remove the iron ba
rs from my wi
ndows, and I would spend some time in my room each afternoon through the short winter days, gazing out over the forest, until dar
kness fell.
   There 
were, as I have already stated, people in the forest. They would come out, some of them, for the Spring Fair: a g
reedy, feral, dangerous people; some were stunted -- dwarfs and midgets and hunchbacks; others had the huge teeth and va
cant gazes of idiots; some had fingers like flippers or crab-claws. They would creep out of the forest each year for the Spri
ng Fair, held when the snows had melted.
   As a young lass I had worked at the Fair, and they had scared me then, the forest fo
lk. I told fortunes for the Fairgoers, scrying in a pool of still water; and, later, when I was older, in a disc of polished glass, its ba
ck all silvered -- a gift from a merchant whose straying horse I had seen in a pool of ink.
   The stallholders at the fair were afraid of the forest folk; th
ey would nail their wares to the bare boards of their stalls -- slabs of gingerbread or lea
ther belts were nailed with great iron nails to the wood. If their wares were not nailed, they said, the forest folk would take them, and run away, chewing o
n the stolen gingerbread, flailing about them with the belts.
   The forest folk had money, though: a coin here, another there, sometimes stained green by tim
e or the earth, the face on the coin unknown to even the oldest of us. Also they had things to trade, and thus the fair continued, serving the outcasts and the dw
arfs, serving the robbers (if they were circumspect) who preyed on the rare travellers from lands beyond the forest, or on gypsies, or on the deer. (This was ro
bbery in the eyes of the law. The deer were the queen's.)
   The years passed by slowly, and my people claimed that I ruled them with wisdom. The heart still hu
ng above by bed, pulsing gently in the night. If there were any who mourned the child, I saw no evidence: she was a thing of terror, back then, and they be
lieved themselves well rid of her.
   Spring Fair followed Spring Fair: five of them, each sadder, poorer, shoddier than the one before. Fewer of the for
est folk came out of the forest to buy. Those who did seemed subdued and listless. The stallholders stopped nailing their wares to the boards of their st
alls. And by the fifth year but a handful of folk came from the forest -- a fearful huddle of little hairy men, and no-one else.
   The Lord of the Fair, a
nd his page, came to me when the fair was done. I had known him slightly, before I was queen.
   "I do not come to you as my queen," he said.
   I said noth
ing. I listened.
   "I come to you because you are wise," he continued. "When you were a child you found a strayed foal by staring into a pool of ink; when yo
u were a maiden you found a lost infant who had wandered far from her mother, by staring into that mirror of yours. You know secrets and you can seek out thin
gs hidden. My queen," he asked, "what is taking the forest folk? Next year there will be no Spring Fair. The travellers from other kingdoms ha
ve grown scarce and few, the folk of the forest are almost gone. Another year like the last, and we shall all starve."
   I commanded my maids
ervant to bring me my looking-glass. It was a simple thing, a silver-backed glass disk, which I kept wrapped in a doe-skin, in a chest, in my cham
ber.
   They brought it to me, then, and I gazed into it: She was twelve and she was no longer a little child. Her skin was still pale, her eyes and h
air coal-black, her lips as red as blood.
   She wore the clothes she had worn when she left the castle for the last time -- the blouse, the skirt, -
- although they were much let-out, much mended. Over them she wore a leather cloak, and instead of boots she had leather bags, tied with thongs, ove
r her tiny feet.
   She was standing in the forest, beside a tree
.
   As I watched, in the eye of my mind, I saw her edge and step and fli
tter and pad from tree to tree, like an animal: a bat or a wolf.
   She was foll
owing someone.
   He was a monk. He wore sackcloth, and his feet were bare, and scab
bed and hard. His beard and tonsure were of a length, overgrown, unshaven.
   She watched him from b
ehind the trees. Eventually he paused for the night, and began to make a fire, laying twigs down, break
ing up a robin's nest as kindling. He had a tinder-box in his robe, and he knocked the flint against the stee
l until the sparks caught the tinder and the fire flamed. There had been two eggs in the nest he had found, and the
se he ate, raw. They cannot have been much of a meal for so big a man.
   He sat there in the firelight, and she came ou
t from her hiding place. She crouched down on the other side of the fire, and stared at him. He grinned, as if it were a lon
g time since he had seen another human, and beckoned her over to him.
   She stood up and walked around the fire, and wait
ed, an arms-length away. He pulled in his robe until he found a coin -- a tiny, copper penny, -- and tossed it to her. She ca
ught it, and nodded, and went to him. He pulled at the rope around his waist, and his robe swung open. His body was as hairy as a bear's. She pu
shed him back onto the moss. One hand crept, spider-like, through the tangle of hair, until it closed on his manhood; the other hand traced a circle on his left n
ipple. He closed his eyes, and fumbled one huge hand under her skirt. She lowered her mouth to the nipple she had been teasing, her smooth skin white on the fu
rry brown body of him.
   She sank her teeth deep into his breast. His eyes opened, then they closed again, and she drank.
   She straddled him, and she fe
d. As she did so a thin blackish liquid began to dribble from between her legs...
   "Do you know what is keeping the travellers from our town? What is happ
ening to the forest people?" asked the Head of the Fair.
   I covered the mirror in doe-skin, and told him that I would personally take it upon myself to m
ake the forest safe once more.
   I had to, although she terrified me. I was the queen.
   A foolish woman would have gone then into the forest and tried to ca
pture the creature; but I had been foolish once and had no wish to be so a second time.
   I spent time with old books, for I could read a little. I sp
ent time with the gypsy women (who passed through our country across the mountains to the south, rather than cross the forest to the no
rth and the west).
   I prepared myself, and obtained those things I would need, and when the first snows began to fall, then I was rea
dy.
   Naked, I was, and alone in the highest tower of the pal
ace, a place open to the sky. The winds chilled my body; goose-pi
mples crept across my arms and thighs and breasts. I carried a silver bas
in, and a basket in which I had placed a silver knife, a silver pin, some tongs, a grey ro
be and three green apples.
   I put them down and stood there, unclothed, on the tower, humble before the night sky and the wind. Had any man seen me standing there, I would have had his eyes; but there was no-one to spy.
   Clouds scudded across the sky, hiding and uncovering the waning moon.
   I took the silver knife, and slashed my left arm -- once, twice, three times. The blood dripped into the basin, scarlet seeming black in the moonlight.
   I added the powd
er from the vial that hung around my neck. It was a brown dust, made of dried herbs and the skin of a particular toad, and from certain other things. It t
hickened the blood, while preventing it from clotting.
   I took the three apples, one by one, a
nd pricked their skins gently with my silver pin. Then I pla
ced the apples in the silver bowl, and let them sit there while the first tiny flakes of snow of the year fell slowly onto my skin, and onto the apples, and onto
 the blood.
   When dawn began to brighten the sky I covered myself with the grey cloak, and took the red apples from the silver bowl, one by one, li
fting each into
 my basket with silver tongs, taking care not to touch it. There was nothing left of my blood or of the brown powder in the silver bowl, save nothing 
save a black r
esidue, like a verdigris, on the inside.
   I buried the bowl in the earth. Then I cast a glamour on the apples
   (as once, years before, by a bridge, 
I had cast a glamour on myself), that they were, beyond any doubt, the most wonderful apples in the world; and the crimson blush of their skins was the warm colour of fresh blood.
   I pulled the hood of my cloak low over my face, and I took ribbons and pretty hair ornaments with me, placed them above the apples in the reed basket, and I walked alone into the forest, until I came to her dwelling: a high, sandstone cliff, laced with deep caves going back a way into the rock wall.
   There were trees and boulders around the cliff-face, and
 I walked quietly and gently from tree to tree, without disturbing a twig or a fallen leaf. Eventually I found my place to hide, and I waited, and
 I watched.
   Aft
er some hours a cl
utch of dwarfs crawled out of the cave-front -- ugly, misshapen, hairy little men, the old inhabitants of this country. You saw them seldom now.
   They vanished into the wood, and none of them spied me, though one of them stopped to piss against the rock I hid behind.
   I waited. No more came out.
   I went to the cave entrance and hallooed into it, in a cracked old voice.
   The scar on my Mound of Venus throbbed and pulsed as she came towards me, out of the darkness, naked and alone.
   She was thirteen years of age, my stepdaughter, and nothing marred the perfect whiteness of her skin save for the livid scar on her left breast, where her heart had been cut from her long since.
   The insides of her thighs were stained with wet black filth.
   She peered at me, hidden, as I was, in my cloak. She looked at me hungrily. "
Ribb
ons, goodwife," I croaked. "Pretty ribbons for your hair..."
   She smiled and beckoned to me. A tug; the scar on my hand was pulling me towards her. I did what I h
ad planned to do, but I did it more readily than I had planned: I dropped my basket, and screeched like the bloodless old pedlar woman I was 
pretending to be, and I ran.
   My grey cloak was the colour of the forest, and I was fast; she did not catch me.
   I made my way back to the 
palace.
   I did not see it. Let us imagine though, the girl returning, frustrated and hungry, to her cave, and finding my fallen basket on the grou
nd.
   What did she do?
   I like to think she played first with the ribbons, twined them into her raven hair, looped them around her pale neck or her t
iny waist.
   And then, curious, she moved the cloth to see what else was in the basket; and she saw the red, red apples.
   They smelled li
ke fresh apples, o
f course; and they also smelled of blood. And she was hungry. I imagine her picking up an apple, pressing it against her cheek, feeling the cold smoo
thness of it against her skin.
   And she opened her mouth and bit deep into it...
   By the time I reached my chambers, the heart t
hat hung from the roof-beam, with the apples and hams and the dried sausages, had ceased to beat. It hung there, quietly, without motion or life, and I fel
t safe once more.
   That winter the snows were high and deep, and were late melting. We were all hungry come the spring.
   The Spring Fair was sligh
tly improved that year. The forest folk were few, but they were there, and there were travellers from the lands beyond the forest.
   I saw the little hai
ry men of the forest-cave buying and bargaining for pieces of glass, and lumps of crystal and of quartz-rock. They paid for the glass with silver coins -- th
e spoils of my stepdaughter's depredations, I had no doubt. When it got about what they were buying, townsfolk rushed back to their homes, came back w
ith their lucky crystals, and, in a few cases, with whole sheets of glass.
   I thought, briefly, about having them killed, but I did not. As long as t
he heart hung, silent and immobile and cold, from the beam of my chamber, I was safe, and so were the folk of the forest, and, thus, eventually, the fol
k of the town.
   My twenty-fifth year came, and my stepdaughter had eaten the poisoned fruit two winters' ba
ck, when the Prince came to my Palace.
   He was tall, very tall, with cold green eyes and the swarthy skin o
f those from beyond the mountains.
   He rode with a small retinue: large enough to defend him, small enough that
 another monarch -- myself, for instance -- would not view him as a potential threat.
   I was practical: I thought of the alliance of our
 lands, thought of the Kingdom running from the forests all the way south to the sea; I thought of my golden-haired bearded love, dead thes
e eight years; and, in the night, I went to the Prince's room.
   I am no innocent, although my late husband, who was once my kin
g, was truly my first lover, no matter what they say.
   At first the prince seemed excited. He bade me remove my shift, and made me sta
nd in front of the opened window, far from the fire, until my skin was chilled stone-cold. Then he asked me to lie upon my back, with my ha
nds folded across my breasts, my eyes wide open - but staring only at the beams above. He told me not to move, and to breathe as little as po
ssible. He implored me to say nothing. He spread my legs apart.
   It was then that he entered me.
   As he began to thrust inside me, I felt my hip
s raise, felt myself begin to match him, grind for grind, push for push. I moaned. I could not help myself.
   His manhood slid out of me. I reached out and to
uched it, a tiny, slippery thing.
   "Please," he said, softly. "You must neither move, nor speak. Just lie there on the stones, so cold and so fair."
   I tri
ed, but he had lost whatever force it was that had made him virile; and, some short while later, I left the Prince's room, his curses and tears still resoun
ding in my ears.
   He left early the next morning, with all his men, and they rode off into the forest.
   I imagine his loins, now, as he rode, a knot of f
